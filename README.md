# Expense-Tracker
I will try and build a fully functional expense tracker in Python so that i can record my expenses. Now i can add my expenses by category. This is my first program that i wrote that uses user input.

Update: I have also added a graphical interface so that i can control the program via a simple window. I have made several improvements from the initial commit. I will explain this features later.

# Future improvements?
I want to do an overhaul of the graphical interface so that its nicer (however graphical design isnt my forte), and i would like to have the ability to backup automatically the log and current stock file (and also auto import it when i open the program), however i dont know how to do this.

This proyect has been on hold for a few months now.
