# Expense-Traker
I will try and build a fully functional expense tracker in Python so that i can record my expenses. Now i can add my expenses by category. 

## Future improvements
I want to add a logging function so that i can see my past expenses once i close the program and a function to also save the date and time of when i added the expense (i thought of also adding an option to add an expense i had previously during the day and not at the current time). Also i should be able to filter the expenses by date/month/year
